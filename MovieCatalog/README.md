# Movie Catalog

This is a simple app that is a sort of clone of the Apple TV app to show how I organize code in a "real" project, as in
the project is simple, but the techniques and care are at the level of my day-job code.

Some ideas may be simplified of course, but in general it's a good indication on how my day-job app looks like in code.

## Setup

First make sure you have an `API_KEY` setup in `MovieCatalog/Config/BaseConfig.xcconfig`.
You get a value from http://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/trending-movies
