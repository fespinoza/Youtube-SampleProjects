# UIKitNavigation

A simple project to showcase how to style the navigation bar in UIKit.

Normally I attempt to show code that is close to how I write code at work, but I don't write UIKit anymore at work,
and I haven't done it in quite a while. Then this code **is not how I would write a _proper_ UIKit app**, it's just
for illustration purposes.

The idea is to explore how to style the `UINavigationBar` in different scenarios.
